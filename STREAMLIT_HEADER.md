# Sayori - render your prose/poems like it's Doki Doki Literature Club!  

Sayori allows you to add more flair to your poems or proses and render them in Doki Doki Literature Club's style, using Python's PIL module to generate images for you to share!

This is a hosted instance in Streamlit, but if you want to run it locally, head to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sr229/Sayori) for installation instructions.
